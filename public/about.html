<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>​I am a lifelong learner currently navigating two exciting worlds: Education and Technology.
   ​Based in Ghana, I am a Level 300 Teacher Trainee specializing in Mathematics (Major) and Science (Minor).
   My background in education has sharpened my ability to break down complex logic into digestible 
   concepts—a skill I apply every day as I transition into the world of Full-Stack Web Development.​</p>


<h2>The Educator</h2>
<p>​In my journey as a teacher trainee, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the "why" behind the "how." 
  My focus on Mathematics allows me to approach problems with a structured, analytical mindset, while my 
  Science minor keeps me curious about how things work under the hood. I believe that teaching is the best 
  way to master any subject, and I bring that pedagogical approach to every line of code I write.</p>

<h2>The Aspiring Developer</h2>
<p>​While I spend my days in the classroom, my nights are dedicated to the screen. I am currently honing 
  my skills in web development, with a focus on building functional, user-friendly applications.
  ​Current Focus: Mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
​  The Goal: To become a Full-Stack Developer who builds tools that make learning more accessible and efficient.</p>

<h2>My Skill Set</h2>
<p>
  ​Education: Lesson Planning, Curriculum Design, Mathematical Logic, Scientific Inquiry.
​  Technology (Learning): HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Responsive Design, and Git/GitHub.
​  Soft Skills: Public Speaking, Technical Writing, Problem Solving, and Adaptability.
</p>

<h2>Why "Math + code"?</h2>
<p>
  ​For me, programming is simply Mathematics in motion. Whether I am solving a complex algebraic equation or 
  debugging a JavaScript function, the goal is the same: to find the most elegant and efficient solution to a problem. 
  My unique background allows me to bridge the gap between technical complexity and clear communication.
  ​When I’m not studying or coding, you can find me staying active in the local tech community, following the latest 
  football matches, or exploring new audio production tools.
